# The-Simpsons-Quiz
A mobile application created for Android which tests users on their knowledge of the Simpsons TV show . This application retrieves JSON data which is manipulated to form the body of the quiz content.

Questions are buffered through implementing a queueing algorithm to give a better overall user experience. JSON retrieval and manipulation is implemented using threads to improve application usability.

Note: 
Due to GitHub's upload size limitations this is the .java files of the project only. Please contact howedaryl@hotmail.com or development@darylhowe.com if you would like access to the full Android Studio project.
